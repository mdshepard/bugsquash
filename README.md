# bugsquash
These are the starter files for the Bug Squash game.

Included are an implementation of the High Scores API in Node/Express. The express server is also also configured to serve up the static files in the public/ directory.
Within the public directory are a basic HTML/javascript implementation of a Whack-a-Mole style game.

The lesson accompanying this project asks you to hook up the client-side game to the server side scorekeeping API by using the browser's Fetch API to make GET and POST requests to the /scores endpoint.
